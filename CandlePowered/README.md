## CandlePowered

Quick implementation for Candle ingesting with Websockets.

Swagger should open by default but it is located at https://localhost:7003.

To run the DB that does the caching and Seq (does structured logging) just run the `docker-compose` file with `docker-compose up`.

Made with .NET 6. Run in favorite NET supported IDE or by using `dotnet run` command from the root of the project.

Docker support TBD
